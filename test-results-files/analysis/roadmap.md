## Phase 3 Objectives

1. **8FSK Performance**: Validate +3 dB waterfall vs 4FSK
2. **Crypto Overhead**: Confirm <1 dB overhead
3. **Fading Robustness**: Validate mobile operation feasibility
4. **Frequency Offset**: Test tolerance for cheap radios

## Key Decision Points

- **8FSK vs 4FSK**: Is audio quality worth 3 dB penalty?
- **Crypto Default**: Enable by default if overhead <0.5 dB?
- **Mobile Support**: Is fading penalty acceptable?

## Future Optimizations

- **Soft-decision LDPC**: Could reduce FER floor to <1%
- **Adaptive Modulation**: Switch 4FSK/8FSK based on SNR
- **Enhanced Sync**: Improve acquisition in fading
